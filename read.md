# Decentralized Traffic Management System

## Overview
This project is a decentralized traffic management system that leverages IoT sensors to collect real-time traffic data and smart contracts to optimize traffic signal timings. The goal is to reduce congestion and improve travel times through autonomous, data-driven decision-making.

## Features
- **Real-Time Traffic Data Collection**: Uses simulated IoT sensors to gather data on traffic volume, speed, and congestion level.
- **Dynamic Traffic Signal Adjustments**: Adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic data to optimize flow.
- **Decentralized Management**: Operates autonomously without the need for centralized control.
- **Transparency and Security**: Data is securely shared and managed, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Simulation**: Python (Random module for mock IoT data)
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: To handle cross-origin requests in Flask
